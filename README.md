# VR_workshopAsset

This project is try to create a VR app to work with meachanical parts
demo: https://youtu.be/PD5vBhq9EGo


The object(ex. bike), that have to be assembled of parts, presented by already collected bike
Further, with code it get disassembled. 
The right way, how it should be assembled, accompanied with different colors of blueprints.
So if you hold detail, the blueprint of the part change color or stay invisible if it's not the
right time to set this detail.

features that already done:
- base movement, camera controller
- hand-holding and moving objects
- interactive color change of the object
- blueprint-system, that allow to assemble in right order
(so, you can't add a wheel if there is no stand for them, or add lighting to the steering, if steering not set)
- base enviroment

features that in procces dev:
- VR input/output
- rotating/movement parts in full assembled object
- differnt difficulties(levels) of objects to work with
- the specification for parts(info table)
- adding instruments for assemble (screwdriver, wrench, hammer etc.)
